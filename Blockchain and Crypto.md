## Blockchain
The purpose of a blockchain is to have a **network of computers agree upon a common state of data**. Plain and simple. _Any_ person or organization should be able to _participate_ in this process. _No_ person or organization should be able to _control_ this process.

Smart Contract blockchains provide developers with a way to decentralize where the code runs. In this way, code can truly become a public resource. This means code can run without any direct ownership, making it censorship resistant and transparently verifiable.

The specific types of hash functions we are going to focus on are **cryptographic** hash functions. These hash functions need five specific properties. They must be:

-    **Deterministic** - One specific input always maps to the **same** specific output
-    **Pseudorandom** - It is not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs
-    **One-way** - If someone gives you a new output, you could not determine an input without guessing
-    **Fast to Compute** - It must be a quick calculation for a computer
-    **Collision-resistant** - The chance of a collision should be infinitesimally small
